# Lopez-REST-API-Project9
Express, Sequelize

In this project I create a REST API using Express. The API allows a user to administer a database containing
information about users and courses. The user can create new courses, retrieve information on courses and update
or delete courses. In order to make changes to the database, the user needs to log in.
